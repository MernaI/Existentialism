SOREN KIERKEGAARD (father of existensialism)
"Selfhood" --> our understanding that our lives are our own and that we seek reason for our existence
                 +primary goal in our life

History is an "objective discipline"
                  +FACT!

<< challenges the notion that history is object >>

Analysis of history is a subjective act --> no truth in narrative
                                                  +just us trying to make sense of a series of historical markers



FRIEDRICH NIETZCHE
            +Was interested in the same questions as Kierkgaard
                       AKA: the search for meaning
                                 +EXPANSION- when meaning doesnt reveal itself to us, we eventually give up...        
                                                        ______NIHILISM_______

<< the meaning of life is so soginificant that the lack of meaning forced you to become nihilisitc >>

"God is Dead" --> shift in European society, increased industrialization...SCIENCE! SCIENCE! SCIENCE! <-----------______MODERNIST MOVEMENT______
        +adressing that this is a challenge of philosophy

THE UBERMENSCH --> we should try to become better than what we were before <-------continue to evolve

Humans are the masters of their own destiny (arbiters of their own fate)



LITERARY DEVELOPMENT
Existentialism was also heavily influenced by: Kafka, Dyoveshky *close enough*

<< trouble discovering identity >>



PRE-WAR EXISTENTIALISM
the increasing technological world and what it means for individual freedom
              +what is mans position in the age of the machine

POST-WAR EXISTENSIALISM
WW2 left Europe destroyed, 60mil DEAD!
        +European philosophers try to make sense of the carnage

philosphical question --> why did WW2 happen in the first place?




ALBERT CAMUS --> Pied-Noir, Algerian Born

Belived happiness and life are fleeting--> while our life has meaning, ultimately it has no meaning
                            "Paradox of the Absurb" --> We live a life trying to unravel the absurdity of our lives, which are both meaningful and -less
